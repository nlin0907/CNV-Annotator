# CNV Annotator

CNV Annotator is a compilation of programs and scripts used to annotate CNVs from CoNIFER calls.txt output

## Usage
Steps:
1) Set up directory 
```python
mkdir annotator
``` 
This directory should already contain biomart_analysis.R and annotate.sh
2) Within directory, 
for GFF3 file in HG38:
```python
 wget http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/docs/DGV.GS.hg38.gff3
```
for GFF3 file in HG37:
```python
 wget http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/docs/DGV.GS.March2016.50percent.GainLossSep.Final.hg19.gff3
```
3) Make sub-directories in the annotator directory for different analyses (i.e. analysis1, analysis2) and place calls.txt from CoNIFER in respective sub-directories
4) Run biomart_analysis.R on each calls.txt for gene, phenotype description, and MIM morbid description and place ref-biomart.txt (biomart_analysis.R output file) in respective sub-directories.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
To use HG38 ensembl genes, replace the following line
```python
ensembl = useMart("ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL", dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl", host="grch37.ensembl.org", path="/biomart/martservice")
```
with
```python
ensembl = useMart("ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL", dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl", host="www.ensembl.org")
```
6) Modify annotate.sh:
Replace lines 3 and 4 
```python 
SDIR=/Users/nicolelin/annotator/analysis3
DIR=/Users/nicolelin/annotator
```
with your own paths. SDIR is path to sub-directory (aka your different analyses). DIR is path to annotator directory.
If you want to use HG38 GFF3 file, replace lines 20, 21, and 26 with
```python
python $DIR/gff_parsing.py $DIR/DGV.GS.hg38.gff3 $DIR/DGVHG38.bed
sort-bed $DIR/DGVHG37.bed > $DIR/sorted_DGVHG38.bed

bedmap --echo --echo-map-id-uniq --fraction-both 0.75 $SDIR/anno_calls3.bed $DIR/sorted_DGVHG38.bed > $SDIR/annotated_calls.bed
```
Now, you're ready to activate the bash script.
7) Give permissions to bash script:
```python 
chmod u+x annotate.sh
```
8) Run annotate.sh:
```python 
./annotate.sh
```
9) The final calls should be in your sub-directory called FINAL_ANNOTATED_CALLS.txt
