# CNV Annotator

CNV Annotator is a compilation of programs and scripts used to annotate CNVs from CoNIFER calls.txt output

## Usage
Steps:
1) Set up directory and install BEDOPS
```python
mkdir annotator
``` 
This directory should contain biomart_analysis.R, annotate.sh, calls_txt_to_bed.py, final_step.py, get_sampleID.py, gff_parsing.py, replace_absolute_value.py, and replaceunderscore.py

2) Within directory, 
for GFF3 file in HG38:
```console
 foo@bar:~$ wget http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/docs/DGV.GS.hg38.gff3
```
for GFF3 file in HG37:
```console
 foo@bar:~$ wget http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/docs/DGV.GS.March2016.50percent.GainLossSep.Final.hg19.gff3
```
3) Make sub-directories in the annotator directory for different analyses (i.e. analysis1, analysis2) and place calls.txt from CoNIFER in respective sub-directories
4) Run biomart_analysis.R on each calls.txt for gene, phenotype description, and MIM morbid description and place ref-biomart.txt (biomart_analysis.R output file) in respective sub-directories. Depending on how your calls.txt file is formatted, you might have to change chrom = line_elements[2] to chrom = line_elements[1], start_in = line_elements[3] to start_in = line_elements[2], and stop_in = line_elements[3] to stop_in = line_elements[2]
IMPORTANT NOTE:
To use HG38 ensembl genes, replace the following line
```python
ensembl = useMart("ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL", dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl", host="grch37.ensembl.org", path="/biomart/martservice")
```
with
```python
ensembl = useMart("ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL", dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl", host="www.ensembl.org")
```
5) Modify annotate.sh:
Replace lines 3 and 4 
```bash 
SDIR=/Users/nicolelin/annotator/analysis3
DIR=/Users/nicolelin/annotator
```
with your own paths. SDIR is path to sub-directory (aka your different analyses). DIR is path to annotator directory.
If you want to use HG38 GFF3 file, replace lines 20, 21, and 26 with
```bash
python $DIR/gff_parsing.py $DIR/DGV.GS.hg38.gff3 $DIR/DGVHG38.bed
sort-bed $DIR/DGVHG38.bed > $DIR/sorted_DGVHG38.bed

bedmap --echo --echo-map-id-uniq --fraction-both 0.75 $SDIR/anno_calls3.bed $DIR/sorted_DGVHG38.bed > $SDIR/annotated_calls.bed
```
Now, you're ready to activate the bash script.
6) Give permissions to bash script:
```console
foo@bar:~$ chmod u+x annotate.sh
```
7) Run annotate.sh:
```console
./annotate.sh
```
8) The final calls should be located in your sub-directory called FINAL_ANNOTATED_CALLS.txt
